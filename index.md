# About Me

I am a 3rd year PhD student in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Institute of Technology. Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My research focuses on high dimensional statistics, data mining and machine learning. I am working with Prof. Yajun Mei.
